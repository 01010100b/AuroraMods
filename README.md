# New json format

- Both the mod.ini in the mod's zipped release and the updates.txt are now gone. In their place is a mod.json. No more need to keep 2 separate files updated and no more need to include extra files in the mod's zipped release.

- Launch commands are now provided on the mod level rather than the mod-version level, so no more versioned exe's: "aurora-electrons-0.4.6.exe" -> "aurora-electrons.exe"
