# New json format

- Both the mod.ini in the mod's zipped release and the updates.txt are now gone. In their place is a mod.json. No more need to keep 2 separate files updated and no more need to include extra files in the mod's zipped release.

- Launch commands are now provided on the mod level rather than the mod-version level, so no more versioned exe's: "aurora-electrons-0.4.6.exe" -> "aurora-electrons.exe"

# Purpose

This repository is an alternative hosting solution for developers of mods and content for Aurora. If you've got stuff to share with other Aurora players and aren't sure where to put it, this might be the place.

## Contributing

Just open a pull request, there are no fancy requirements. If you want your mod to work with Aurora Loader, there _are_ requirements - see below.

## Adding your mod to the registry

Many of the mods hosted here are designed to be used with the [Aurora Loader](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraLoader). If you're a mod or content author and want your work to be discoverable from that tool, see instructions at the [Aurora Registry](https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraRegistry).
